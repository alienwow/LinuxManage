################################# REPLICATION #################################

#Redis 的主从复制配置非常容易，但我们先来了解一下它的一些特性。

#1、redis 使用异步复制。从 redis 2.8 开始，slave 也会周期性的告诉 master 现在的数据量。可能只是个机制，用途应该不大。
#2、一个 master 可以拥有多个 slave，废话，这也是业界的标配吧。
#3、slave 可以接收来自其他 slave 的连接。意思是不是就是说 slave 在接收其他的slave的连接之后成为 master ？等下我们来验证。
#4、redis 复制在 master 这一端是非阻塞的，也就是说在和 slave 同步数据的时候，master 仍然可以执行客户端的操作命令而不受其影响。
#5、redis 复制在 slave 这一端也是非阻塞的。在配置文件里面有 replica-serve-stale-data 这一项，
#		如果它为 yes ，slave 在执行同步时，它可以使用老版本的数据来处理查询请求，如果是 no ，slave 将返回一个错误。
#		在完成同步后，slave 需要删除老数据，加载新数据，在这个阶段，slave 会阻止连接进来。
#6、Replication can be used both for scalability, in order to have multiple slaves for read-only queries (for example, heavy SORT operations can be offloaded to slaves), or simply for data redundancy.这句话我也没理解什么意思。
#7、使用复制可以避免 master 因为需要把全部的数据集写入磁盘而造成的开销，
#		因此可以把 master 中 save 配置项全部注释掉，不让它进行保存，然后配置 slave ，让 slave 保存。虽然有这个特性，但是我们好像一般不这么做。

# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of replicas.
# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# 主从复制。使用 slaveof 来让一个 redis 实例成为另一个reids 实例的副本。
# 注意这个只需要在 slave 上配置。
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the replica request.
#
# 如果 master 需要密码认证，就在这里设置
# masterauth <master-password>
#
# However this is not enough if you are using Redis ACLs (for Redis version
# 6 or greater), and the default user is not capable of running the PSYNC
# command and/or other commands needed for replication. In this case it's
# better to configure a special user to use with replication, and specify the
# masteruser configuration as such:
#
# masteruser <username>
#
# When masteruser is specified, the replica will authenticate against its
# master using the new AUTH form: AUTH <username> <password>.

# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO, replicaOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG,
#    SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB,
#    COMMAND, POST, HOST: and LATENCY.
#
# 当一个 slave 与 master 失去联系，或者复制正在进行的时候，
# slave 可能会有两种表现：
#
# 1) 如果为 yes ，slave 仍然会应答客户端请求，但返回的数据可能是过时，
#    或者数据可能是空的在第一次同步的时候
#
# 2) 如果为 no ，在你执行除了 info he salveof 之外的其他命令时，
#    slave 都将返回一个 "SYNC with master in progress" 的错误，
#
replica-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
#
# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
#
# 你可以配置一个 slave 实体是否接受写入操作。
# 通过写入操作来存储一些短暂的数据对于一个 slave 实例来说可能是有用的，
# 因为相对从 master 重新同步数而言，据数据写入到 slave 会更容易被删除。
# 但是如果客户端因为一个错误的配置写入，也可能会导致一些问题。
#
# 从 redis 2.6 版起，默认 slaves 都是只读的。
#
replica-read-only yes

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the
# replication process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a
# "full synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the
# replicas.
#
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the replicas incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child
# producing the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead
# once the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new
# transfer will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple
# replicas will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the replicas.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the
# server waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: RDB diskless load is experimental. Since in this setup the replica
# does not immediately store an RDB on disk, it may cause data loss during
# failovers. RDB diskless load + Redis modules not handling I/O reads may also
# cause Redis to abort in case of I/O errors during the initial synchronization
# stage with the master. Use only if your do what you are doing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Replica can load the RDB it reads from the replication link directly from the
# socket, or store the RDB to a file and read that file after it was completely
# recived from the master.
#
# In many cases the disk is slower than the network, and storing and loading
# the RDB file may increase replication time (and even increase the master's
# Copy on Write memory and salve buffers).
# However, parsing the RDB file directly from the socket may mean that we have
# to flush the contents of the current database before the full rdb was
# received. For this reason we have the following options:
#
# "disabled"    - Don't use diskless load (store the rdb file to the disk first)
# "on-empty-db" - Use diskless load only when it is completely safe.
# "swapdb"      - Keep a copy of the current db contents in RAM while parsing
#                 the data directly from the socket. note that this requires
#                 sufficient memory, if you don't have it, you risk an OOM kill.
repl-diskless-load disabled

# Replicas send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to
# change this interval with the repl_ping_replica_period option. The default
# value is 10 seconds.
#
# Slaves 在一个预定义的时间间隔内发送 ping 命令到 server 。
# 你可以改变这个时间间隔。默认为 10 秒。
#
# repl-ping-replica-period 10

# 设置主从复制过期时间
#
# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of replica.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of replicas (data, pings).
# 3) Replica timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-replica-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the replica.
# 这个值一定要比 repl-ping-replica-period 大
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the replica socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to replicas. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the replica side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the replica side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and replicas are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# replica data when replicas are disconnected for some time, so that when a
# replica wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a
# partial resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the replica
# missed while disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the replica can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a replica connected.
#
# 设置主从复制容量大小。这个 backlog 是一个用来在 slaves 被断开连接时
# 存放 slave 数据的 buffer，所以当一个 slave 想要重新连接，通常不希望全部重新同步，
# 只是部分同步就够了，仅仅传递 slave 在断开连接时丢失的这部分数据。
#
# 这个值越大，salve 可以断开连接的时间就越长。
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no longer connected replicas for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
# resynchronize" with the replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# 在某些时候，master 不再连接 slaves，backlog 将被释放。
# 如果设置为 0 ，意味着绝不释放 backlog 。
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO
# output. It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote
# into a master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel
# will pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
# 当 master 不能正常工作的时候，Redis Sentinel 会从 slaves 中选出一个新的 master，
# 这个值越小，就越会被优先选中，但是如果是 0 ， 那是意味着这个 slave 不可能被选中。
#
# 默认优先级为 100。
replica-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.

############################### KEYS TRACKING #################################

# Redis implements server assisted support for client side caching of values.
# This is implemented using an invalidation table that remembers, using
# 16 millions of slots, what clients may have certain subsets of keys. In turn
# this is used in order to send invalidation messages to clients. Please
# to understand more about the feature check this page:
#
#   https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
#
# When tracking is enabled for a client, all the read only queries are assumed
# to be cached: this will force Redis to store information in the invalidation
# table. When keys are modified, such information is flushed away, and
# invalidation messages are sent to the clients. However if the workload is
# heavily dominated by reads, Redis could use more and more memory in order
# to track the keys fetched by many clients.
#
# For this reason it is possible to configure a maximum fill value for the
# invalidation table. By default it is set to 1M of keys, and once this limit
# is reached, Redis will start to evict keys in the invalidation table
# even if they were not modified, just to reclaim memory: this will in turn
# force the clients to invalidate the cached values. Basically the table
# maximum size is a trade off between the memory you want to spend server
# side to track information about who cached what, and the ability of clients
# to retain cached objects in memory.
#
# If you set the value to 0, it means there are no limits, and Redis will
# retain as many keys as needed in the invalidation table.
# In the "stats" INFO section, you can find information about the number of
# keys in the invalidation table at every given moment.
#
# Note: when key tracking is used in broadcasting mode, no memory is used
# in the server side so this setting is useless.
#
# tracking-table-max-keys 1000000
